# Hello there
~~General Kenobi~~
I am Thayen, a Canadian College student currently going through his first year of Computer Programming and Analysis.
I enjoy coding in my spare time, but am particularly interested in low level computing topics such as Operating Systems, Compilers/Programming Languages, and physical hardware. While also reinventing the many wheels coders before me have made.

I enjoy learning in many forms but particularly things related to programming/computer science, mathematics, physics, politics, and history.

I would currently call myself proficient with a few languages such as:
- C#
- C

Though I have also dabbled or started learning several others like:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- Erlang
- Clojure
