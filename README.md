# Hello there
~~General Kenobi~~
I am Thayen, a Canadian College student currently going through his second year of Fanshawe's Computer Programming and Analysis.
I enjoy learning and improving my knowledge in any computing topic in my spare time, but am particularly interested in low level computing topics including as Operating Systems, Compilers/Programming Languages and their optimizations, physical hardware, and runtime environments. While also reinventing and learning the many wheels coders before me have made.

I enjoy learning topics such as programming/computer science, mathematics, physics, politics, and history; streaming youtube or another provider, and the occasional gaming periods.

I would currently call myself proficient with a few languages such as:
- C#
- C

Though I have also dabbled or started learning several others like:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- Erlang
- Clojure
