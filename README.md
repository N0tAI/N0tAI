## Hello there
~~General Kenobi!~~
I am N0tAI, a Canadian College student currently going through his first year of Computer Programming and Analysis.
I enjoy coding in my spare time, but particularly lean towards low level aspects such as Operating Systems, Compilers/Programming Languages, and reinventing the many wheels coders before me have made.

I enjoy learning in many forms but particularly things related to programming, computer science, and history.
