# Hello there
I am Thayen, a Canadian college student currently going through his third year of Fanshawe's Computer Programming and Analysis.
I enjoy learning and improving my knowledge in any computing topic in my spare time, but am particularly interested in learning how things work under the hood which has attracted me towards low level computing topics such as Operating Systems and Drivers, Compilers and Programming Languages, Computer Hardware, and Runtime Environments. I also try to reinvent and/or analyze the many other forms of software that exist when my interest is drawn.

Outside of computing I am a very stereotypical nerd, enjoying learning about subjects like mathematics, physics, politics, and history; While I also enjoy reading and gaming particularly in the Science Fiction, Fantasy, Cosmic Horror, and New Weird genres.

## Languages
I would currently call myself proficient with C, C++ and C#. I am a fan of functional programming languages and have worked with languages like Clojure and Erlang and I aim to create projects in them soon. I can and do write posix compliant and bash shell scripts.

## Other Skills
I have some proficiency with computer hardware having built my desktop and maintain (clean, update/replace hardware) on my older laptops myself.
I daily drive an Arch Linux system on my desktop (I don't dual boot) with the intention of trying to provide my own solutions to problems I encounter myself (often being solved as shell scripts).
